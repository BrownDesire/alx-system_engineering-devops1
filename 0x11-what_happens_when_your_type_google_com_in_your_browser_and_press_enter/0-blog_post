When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press enter, you are initiating a complex sequence of events that allows you to access Google's website. Let's take a closer look at each step of this process, from the initial DNS request to the final database query.

DNS Request: When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser, the first thing that happens is a DNS (Domain Name System) request. Your browser sends a request to a DNS server, asking for the IP address of the server that hosts the Google website. The DNS server responds with the IP address, allowing your browser to initiate a connection.

TCP/IP: Once your browser has the IP address, it uses the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol to establish a connection with the server. TCP/IP ensures that data is sent and received reliably over the internet, and is used for most internet communications.

Firewall: When your browser establishes a connection with the server, the server's firewall may come into play. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic, and can help protect against unauthorized access.

HTTPS/SSL: After the connection is established, your browser and the server negotiate an HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) connection. HTTPS is a secure version of the HTTP protocol, and is used to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and the server. The encryption is provided by SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol.

Load-balancer: Google's website is hosted on a cluster of servers, and a load-balancer is used to distribute traffic across these servers. The load-balancer ensures that requests are evenly distributed among the servers, helping to improve performance and prevent overload.

Web Server: When your browser sends a request to the server, it is received by a web server. The web server is responsible for processing the request, and generating a response that is sent back to your browser. Google uses a custom web server called Google Web Server, which is optimized for handling large volumes of traffic.

Application Server: Some requests may require additional processing, such as querying a database or executing server-side code. In these cases, the web server may pass the request to an application server. The application server is responsible for processing the request and generating a response, which is then sent back to the web server for delivery to your browser.

Database: Finally, some requests may require data to be retrieved from a database. Google uses a variety of databases to store and manage its vast amounts of data, including Bigtable, a proprietary database system developed by Google.

In summary, typing "https://www.google.com" into your browser and pressing enter initiates a complex sequence of events that involves DNS requests, TCP/IP connections, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL encryption, load-balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. Understanding how this process works can help you better understand how the internet works and how websites are hosted and delivered.
